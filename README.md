## WorkApp App Project Description
**WorkApp** is a Domestic Violence Safety Planning application that acts as a hub to connect domestic violence victims with resources and trauma-informed specialists that can help develop an individualized safety plan with them. Statistically, the most dangerous time for domestic violence victims is when they leave their abuser(s). For this reason, careful safety planning for is necessary to ensure their safe escape, access to resources, and to assist them with regaining long-term independence and continued safety. Many domestic violence victim(s) feel trapped in situations that feel impossible to escape, stay out of fear that escaping will be too dangerous, too difficult, and/or unachievable, and they are unaware of local and remote resources available to them to develop a safe escape plan, regain abuse-free independence, and maintain long-term safety. Often times, these resources are inaccessible to victim(s), and the mission behind the **WorkApp** app is to help overcome these obstacles with features prioritize victim safety and confidentiality; such as a quick-exit button on all pages of the application, and secure login with JWT tokens. 
In addition to safely escaping domestic violence situations, it is important that victim(s) receive access to trauma-informed care, counseling, support groups, domestic violence educational resources, safety training, and resources such as grants, scholarships, and charitable organizations that will help them regain independence and rebuild their lives. Some victims are codependent upon their abusers, experience trauma-bonding, and they leave abusive situations having lost housing, finances, belongings, transportation, relationships of various sorts, and even their support-network in order to safely escape. It is important that victim(s) can visualize, experience, and begin to see a plan-of-action form and be implemented that will help them regain independence while maintaining safety.
**WorkApp** links domestic violence victims to informative domestic violence resources and confidential services provided by trauma-informed specialists within closest vicinity of the victims zipcode; such as:

## Project Team Members
- Jeremy Bosquez (Software Developer)

## Project Requirements

### The minimum project requirements are as follows:
- Front End Framework (React/Angular)
- Back End Framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring)
- Database (SQL or NoSQL, API)
- Styled with CSS
- Responsive
  
## **WorkApp App Stretch Goals**
These stretch goals are NOT required, however, are goals we strive to reach after completing the project requirements.
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Create a User Registration and Login (using Node, Express, My SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS) with JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users (Andraya/Heather leading with collaboration from team)
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Deployed to a cloud server (Azure - Jermey Bosquez leading this part with collaboration from team)
  
## Project Plan: WorkApp - HVAC Technician Assistance Application

1. Project Overview
   - Develop WorkApp, an application to assist HVAC technicians in appointment creation, scheduling services, location services, FAQs page, and the ability to upload images for trouble calls.
   - The application will have a user-friendly interface, be responsive, and styled with CSS.

2. Technology Stack
   - Front-end Framework: React
   - Back-end Framework: Node.js with Express
   - Database: SQL or NoSQL (to be determined)
   - API: Create RESTful APIs for communication between front-end and back-end
   - Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user registration and login
   - Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku)

3. Project Timeline

   Phase 1: Backend Development
   - Set up the project structure and dependencies
   - Create API endpoints for appointment creation, service scheduling, and location services
   - Implement database integration for storing appointment and service data
   - Add API endpoints for FAQs and image upload functionality
   - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT tokens

   Phase 2: Frontend Development
   - Design and implement the user interface using React
   - Create screens and components for appointment creation, service scheduling, and location services
   - Develop a FAQs page to display commonly asked questions and answers
   - Implement image upload functionality for trouble calls

   Phase 3: Integration and Testing
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API endpoints
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure proper functionality and data flow
   - Test the application's responsiveness and compatibility with different devices and screen sizes
   - Address any bugs or issues identified during testing

   Phase 4: Deployment and Finalization
   - Deploy the application to a cloud server for accessibility
   - Conduct thorough testing in the production environment
   - Perform any necessary optimizations or refinements based on user feedback
   - Finalize documentation, including user guides and technical documentation

4. Stretch Goals

   Stretch Goal 1: User Registration and Login
   - Develop a user registration and login system using Node.js, Express, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
   - Implement JWT tokens for authentication and authorization of users

   Stretch Goal 2: Deployment to a Cloud Server
   - Deploy the application to a cloud server, such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku
   - Configure the necessary infrastructure for scalability and availability

5. Project Deliverables

   - Completed and tested application source code
   - Deployed application accessible on a cloud server
   - Documentation, including user guides and technical documentation
   - Presentation/demo showcasing the application's features and functionality

Please note that this project plan provides a general outline and timeline for developing the WorkApp HVAC technician assistance application. The specific tasks, durations, and resources required may vary depending on the team's size, expertise, and other project-specific factors. It is recommended to break down the project into smaller tasks, estimate durations, and allocate resources accordingly to ensure successful project completion.
