# WorkApp App Project Description




## Project Team Members
- Jeremy Bosquez (Software Developer)

## Project Requirements

### The minimum project requirements are as follows:
- Front End Framework (React/Angular)
- Back End Framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring)
- Database (SQL or NoSQL, API)
- Styled with CSS
- Responsive
  
## WorkApp App Stretch Goals
These stretch goals are NOT required, however, are goals we strive to reach after completing the project requirements.
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Create a User Registration and Login (using Node, Express, My SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS) with JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users (Andraya/Heather leading with collaboration from team)
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Deployed to a cloud server (Azure - Jermey Bosquez leading this part with collaboration from team)
  
## Project Plan: WorkApp - HVAC Technician Assistance Application

1. Project Overview
   - Develop WorkApp, an application to assist HVAC technicians in appointment creation, scheduling services, location services, FAQs page, and the ability to upload images for trouble calls.
   - The application will have a user-friendly interface, be responsive, and styled with CSS.

2. Technology Stack
   - Front-end Framework: React
   - Back-end Framework: Node.js with Express
   - Database: SQL or NoSQL (to be determined)
   - API: Create RESTful APIs for communication between front-end and back-end
   - Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user registration and login
   - Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku)

3. Project Timeline

   Phase 1: Backend Development
   - Set up the project structure and dependencies
   - Create API endpoints for appointment creation, service scheduling, and location services
   - Implement database integration for storing appointment and service data
   - Add API endpoints for FAQs and image upload functionality
   - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT tokens

   Phase 2: Frontend Development
   - Design and implement the user interface using React
   - Create screens and components for appointment creation, service scheduling, and location services
   - Develop a FAQs page to display commonly asked questions and answers
   - Implement image upload functionality for trouble calls

   Phase 3: Integration and Testing
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API endpoints
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure proper functionality and data flow
   - Test the application's responsiveness and compatibility with different devices and screen sizes
   - Address any bugs or issues identified during testing

   Phase 4: Deployment and Finalization
   - Deploy the application to a cloud server for accessibility
   - Conduct thorough testing in the production environment
   - Perform any necessary optimizations or refinements based on user feedback
   - Finalize documentation, including user guides and technical documentation

4. Stretch Goals

   Stretch Goal 1: User Registration and Login
   - Develop a user registration and login system using Node.js, Express, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
   - Implement JWT tokens for authentication and authorization of users

   Stretch Goal 2: Deployment to a Cloud Server
   - Deploy the application to a cloud server, such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku
   - Configure the necessary infrastructure for scalability and availability

5. Project Deliverables

   - Completed and tested application source code
   - Deployed application accessible on a cloud server
   - Documentation, including user guides and technical documentation
   - Presentation/demo showcasing the application's features and functionality

Please note that this project plan provides a general outline and timeline for developing the WorkApp HVAC technician assistance application. The specific tasks, durations, and resources required may vary depending on the team's size, expertise, and other project-specific factors. It is recommended to break down the project into smaller tasks, estimate durations, and allocate resources accordingly to ensure successful project completion.
